Integration
###########

Documentation
*************

Description
===========

Bazel is the build/test infrastructure of choice for the Score project.
Overall integration and build should be realized using available rules
or custom rules developed for the project. This means that the following
should be integrated with bazel:

-  code build
-  documentation build
-  test runs
-  binary runs
-  external tooling

Running external tooling outside of Bazel should be limited as much as
possible, in order to streamline the development with simple ``bazel
{build,test,run}`` command, across multiple repositories and multiple
languages.

All dependencies should be managed thru mechanisms available in Bazel.
Dependency to host system should be limited as much as possible.

Each repository should register an entry in the bazel_registry for
dependency management between different modules.

High level integration dependency

|score_high_level_dependencies|

Mandatory repositories:

-  bazel_registry (implicit dependency, stores version of all modules)
-  process_description (Score development process description)
-  score (requirements and architecture)
-  reference_integration (brings all parts together)

Optional repositories:

-  repositories containing implementation of particular features
